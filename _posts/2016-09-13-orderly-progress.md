### Disorder:Necessary to Progress?

*Ordem e Progresso*. 

I have always love the pure modernism of the Brazilian bandeira. 

The *lema* or slogan -- order and progress -- can assume a sinister tone at times, however, as when the progressive order of things is upset by tanks and generalíssimos or by a Paraguayan coup d'etat as it was this year. Why progress first and then order will come easier?

In truth, Brazil is still a not terribly orderly place on the whole -- Sambodia is far from a microcosm of the country as a whole -- and progress has yet to reach many parts of it.

It ranks in 74th place in terms of Net penetration with a figure of 51.6% according to [the Internet Society](http://www.internetsociety.org/), less than that [according to another](https://www.statista.com/topics/2045/internet-usage-in-brazil/).

### The Brazilian Net (The Usual Stats) 

According to [another measure](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/brazil/) Brazilhas 140 million users or 66.4% penetration,  (I tend to doubt these figures, which seem to include [LAN house usage](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_house) Brazilian still only has 100 million voters and registration is mandatory). 

It has, however pentrated the Brazilian urban middle class -- a beleaguered and paranoid bunch like their counterparts in Bolivia, Venezuela, and Paraguay and others, though the category grew subtantially under Lula da Silva. 

### Smartphones for Minimum Wagers

I am always surprised to meet people who early one or two minimum salaries who nevertheless managed to  wield a Samsung smartphone or the like. THey buy them *parcelados* or in tiny parcels of up to 36x -- 36 *vezes* or installments 

(Somewhere here in my blogs from 2006 to 2015 I have a very funny photo of a Brazilian using the fabulous Internet: He has an old B&W TV for a monitor and hard drive and a manual typewriter for a keyboard and iron -- for pressing linen -- as a mouse. Too bad I did not tag that post properly, with «humor», for instance.)

These have taken to the Internet and the smartphone like *urubus* to a *boi morto*. Remember Orkut? The Brazilian invasion?

#### Designing the Web for Tupi Eyeballs

![](https://braytonio.github.io/img/yellowpageviewscaled.png)

One thing is for sure: there is a lot of work to be done serving up content and data structure to ravenously curious Tupi eyeballs. Although there are [many agencies doing this work](https://www.abraweb.com.br/), and winning international prizes for it, there is little in the way of **open source** 

So maybe I could be a part of that, to supplement my translation income. I could design for [ONGs and OSCIPs](http://abong.org.br ) -- NGOs -- and professional practices and artists and their ateliers. 

Maybe Gigi and Sandra will let me do them a site on GitHub, where they could host under their own domain with a [CNAME](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/). They are on [Wordpress](https://gigisandra.wordpress.com/) now and the solution is less than ideal. 

I offered to *dar um jeito* in the Wix site of an acquaintance of mine as well, although his [Wix site](http://www.luizfernandofontesteixeira.com.br/) in plain and simple Bootstrap is really not so bad.

(I like his essay on the fetishism of the journalis	tic profession. In Brazil your are not a journalist until you have a subject-specific B.A. and a professional license.)

### But I Digress!

But I digress! 

Pathologically so sometimes.

A bad habit. 

If I seriously pretend to progress as a Web designer in the coming year, I need order -- a method in my [static site generation](https://www.staticgen.com/) and [flat-file](http://www.flatphile.co/) and [Laravel](http://laraveldaily.com/review-top-5-laravel-based-cmss/) madness.

Also, *entia non multiplicanda sunt*. 

Do not multiply sites and blogs unnecessarily.

### Starting With Tweaks

This blog, for example, I did not intend to use much, but I would like to work on making a couple of changes: the typography of `<blockquote`> for example.

More substantially, I want to make some tweaks to the auto-excerpt function. I would like to be able to select a point at which to implement a `<!--more-->`link.

It is also possible to use a background image with a white font displayed against it. I have seen this. How to?

### Cleaning the Home Directory

`home/bretonio/Sites`is overflowing.

And so I have projects in mind to help me get organized and set priorities. 

One is a development diary in Portuguese, made with Hugo and hosted on [surge](http://gringolalia.surge.sh). 

It has a [project page](https://gringolalia.surge.sh/page/projetos/) where I have begun to hash out what I might do first. 

I could probably learn a lot from working on simple Bootstrap theming for [Yellow](https://developers.datenstrom.se/help/how-to-make-a-blog) and something like [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-bootswatch). 	

(A nice custom theme for MkDocs is `pip install mkdocs-material` ... )

The latter I am using to produce a [documentation site](http://sambojana-docs.surge.sh/#comandos) containing cheat sheets for various tools I plan to use. 

I will write it in Portuguese to get better at the technical lingo and to encourage collaboration with *brazucos(as)*.

But I will have to cull the list of platforms down to a usable few. 

Jekyll and Hugo top the list, of course, but I am still testing some of the more obscure [Node.js-based generators](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js). 

Be satisfied with what you have learned to date, ô Bretônio. 

Get started with a simple `hugo new theme samboja`

A little order really is the key to progress, although we can still allow ourselves a moment of madness or risky business from time to time. 

You cannot be afraid to push things until they break. 

I did that with [Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) for quite a long time! Debian and Ubuntu and SUSE and Fedora & variants of Arch. 

Just make sure you back things up.
