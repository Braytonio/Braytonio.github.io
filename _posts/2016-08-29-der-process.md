The trial of President Dilma Rousseff is the story of the hour here in Sambodia. 

Since we no longer have basic cable, we search for a live feed of Dilma's testimony. 

It is difficult to find. 

Neuza finally locates it [on the site of the 
Spanish daily El País](http://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/08/29/politica/1472443953_429513.html), Brazilian edition.

>Hoje eu só temo a morte da democracia.

«My only fear this day is for the death of democracy», Dilma says.

### Coverage to Coverage

The following image is large, and I have yet to find out how to scale with Jekyll -- needs [Imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) -- so scroll down for the [time being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Time), please.

El País has [an excellent technical summary](http://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/08/28/politica/1472412248_958761.html) of the impeachment charges -- see below -- whilst Globo focuses on tabloid emotions and dramatic exchanges inside the Senate. No wonder. Globo is the greatest soap opera factory in the world. 

I am a bit confused by the «ao vivo» tag on its G1 portal, meanwhile. That video appears to have been recorded earlier, and comes with a very long, non-dismissable advertisement.  

The Silver Venus, as it is known, and other media outlets -- there are shockingly few  on the Brazilian media landscape -- have also pointedly referred to the opposition senators bent on the impeachment of Dilma as «the government benches» or «the government (coalition)  -- as though the removal of Rousseff were a fait accompli. 

Say it often enough and it becomes true. 

Now, as it often does when Brazil is in the international headlines, Globo covers the coverage, though often a lot gets lost in translation. 

Where Globo reports blandly on the «close attention» paid to the case by the foreign press, Der Spiegel, for example, uses the terms *machtkampf* and *putsch* in its banner headline. Loaded terms, I would say.

We should check whether the coverage reviewed by Globo in representative of the entire range of opinion. 

A [Google News search](https://news.google.com/news/story?ncl=d66RWHyAqHIuBmMK48P1C_ycbN6mM&q=rousseff&lr=English&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiuzeOyqufOAhUHjZAKHdYIDSkQqgIIKjAA) -- without the `br`-- shows coverage by BBC, Guardian, Washington Post, NPR, Swiss Info, USA Today, CNBC, and the Wall Street Journal, all filed  at noon. 

Oh, and Newswek, [Heavy](http://heavy.com/news/2016/08/brazil-president-dilma-rousseff-impeach-senate-economy-recession-budget-corruption-scandal/) and the Telegraph. And many more

And that does not include other French & German-speaking sources other than Spiegel and Le Monde.

We should also check whether the foreign press sources that are described really say what Globo says they do. 

Globo lies.

### Meanwhile, Back in Sambodia

El País, meanwhile, back in Sambodia, does us  the service of explicating the impeachment charges and how to grok the «stew» of legalese in the case:

>Pedaladas, decretos de suplementação orçamentária, Plano Safra, meta fiscal. A sopa de termos que envolve o impeachment de Dilma Rousseff, que desde quinta-feira é julgada no Senado Federal, dificulta a compreensão até mesmo dos espectadores mais atentos. Mas, afinal, do que a presidenta afastada é acusada? Explicamos abaixo cada ponto da denúncia que, ao final, enseja uma guerra de interpretações jurídicas.

### Enquanto Isso No Meu Cafofo

Neuza, a life-long *[petista](http://www.pt.org.br/)*, is very excited and inspired and simultaneously rendered despairing by today's developments. 

The Facebook jungle telegraph is calling us to the Avenida Paulista for an anti-impeachment street protest but I am already in my pyjamas and smoking jacket and on my third *ouisquinho escocês* -- let the world go to hell. 

I have done more than enough marching for this life -- the last time was the 2004 Republican Convention in New York City and I was mainly on the streets to film the protests in an ironic light. 

Most often the invasion of Iraq to punish Bin Laden -- how grotesque was that? -- goes ahead in any case.
