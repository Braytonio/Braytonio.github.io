Above: the flat-file [Yellow CMS](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow). I can insert images. 

I do not like the automatic summary feature in this theme and would like to work around it. Anyone?

I dedicate this first [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) post to [Neuza Paranhos](https://neuza-paranhos.github.io/) and [Luiz Fernando Fontes-Teixeira](http://www.luizfernandofontesteixeira.com.br/). 

They of all people understand the guilty pleasure I take in my constant digital culture hacking.

Luiz Fernando, your Wix site is not as hideous as I said it was. 

I was just trying to drum up business.

The title of this site is subject to change, by the way.

I am an [anagram](http://wordsmith.org/anagram/) and [Oulipo](http://www.languageisavirus.com/articles/articles.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1161978000#.V78-JWQrLVM) enthusiast, but not everyone gets this. And I do want to be taken seriously. I am serious about my satire and my Sprachspiel and mmy jouissance!

### Here In Brazil

Here in Brazil, [the major news story](http://g1.globo.com/politica/processo-de-impeachment-de-dilma/noticia/2016/08/aliada-de-dilma-pede-suspensao-do-impeachment-no-inicio-do-julgamento.html) is the commencement of an impeachment trial to remove President Dilma Rousseff, currently suspended after a vote in the lower house.

What is remarkable -- or would be if the handful of Brazilian news zaibatsus were not the massive bias machines that they are -- is that practically none of the major dailies are treating this as the major story of the day. It is not even the top story on Google News.

There seems to be a conspiracy of silence bent on conditioning the reader to believe that the outcome is a fait accompli. 

The interim government has been treated since the beginning as «the government» and coverage of «the government» focuses mainly on its long-term plans and prospects. 

The foreign minister behaves like there is no reason not to utterly 
change, overnight, the course of diplomacy over the past 15 years, and a round of privatizations, a long-term process, are already underway.

You wonder whether the official portraits of Temer *presidente* are ready to distribute. 

That being said, according to [the running tally of votes in the Senate maintained by the Estado de S. Paulo](http://infograficos.estadao.com.br/politica/placar-do-impeachment-senadores/), only five more votes are needed to achieve the supermajority required to remove Rousseff for good and all.

Personally, I rely on [Luis Nassif](http://jornalggn.com.br/luisnassif) and others in the [blogprog](http://blogprog.com.br/) community for analysis and diverse points of view.

### Blogs Non Multiplicanda Sunt

But here I am, blogging more Brazil when I have a well-established and very occasionally well-read blog on this subject in [The New World Lusophone Sousaphone](https://tupiwire.wordpress.com/). 

The Tuba has a Portuguese-language sibling, [O Bicho-Preguiça](https://obicho.wordpress.com/) -- the three-toed sloth. 

Motto: Sloth is the mother of all virtues. 

I have used it to practice my Lusophone prose and have published some media studies essays -- channeling Barthes and Eco as dimly remembered from grad school days -- that readers seemed to link, I mean like. 

I have exported both blogs in XML format and am studying [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/)'s ability to churn them into static pages, but it looks complicated, and besides, we are talking here about 2,500 posts over six or seven years. 

I am doubting that this blog will be able to keep up with that sort of volume if I continue at this rate. 

Best make it a repository for finished writings. If any. 

### And On The Seventh Paragraph I Rested

And there was evening and there was morning and there was the first post.
