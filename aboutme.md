### Dates & Data

Colin Brayton is a SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil based translator, editor and journalist,  hailing originally from Brooklyn, New York by way of Berkeley, California. 

Colin has a master's degree in Comparative Literature from Berkeley in Medieval literature and also completed a ton doctoral coursework in Romance Philology while teaching lit to freshmen.

This was before getting a life, moving to New York, and going to work as a journeyman copy editor. 

Among many gigs, I -- back to the first person -- worked as copy chief of an Internet economy publication -- this was pre-9/11 -- and as managing editor and interim chief a securities industry weekly. 

Lots of fascinating stories on the early days of enterprise Linux on a massive scale. 

And so on. 

Remarkably, some of my Blogger blogs from those days are still live. [The Confessions of a Blind Tangerine](http://blindtangerine.blogspot.com.br/). [The Red Actor](http://blindtangerine.blogspot.com.br/). And [The Hairy Eyeball](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hairyeyeball.net) is in The Wayback Machine, dating from May 2002. 

But I still need to find where I blogged Nine-Eleven.

Colin is married to [Neuzas Paranhos](https://www.facebook.com/neuza.paranhos), a *paulistana* journalist, translator and soon to be novelist. 

### The Post-Modern Publshing Professional

Write here about keeping up all the latest trends in publishing and how I have personakl experience in everything from linotype -- as a paperboy with the [South Pasadena Review](https://www.facebook.com/South-Pasadena-Review-629113357233067/) in the early 1970s -- to dedicated WordPerfect terminals and phototypesetting to making a Quark server play nice with a ColdFusion Web server and so on and so forth.

I was around when [blogs were invented and designated as such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_blogging#2001.E2.80.932004) and [Dan https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hairyeyeball.netBricklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin), I think it was -- father of the spreadsheet -- came out with something I think it was called HomeSite. Or was that the [Macromedia product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite)? 

Time marches on and senility sets in.

### Current Projects

I have just finished testing a ton of flat-file CMS solutions and a ton and a half of static site generators over the past few months. 

I have a working toolset now, one that I am fairly adept and using -- considering I majored in poetry -- and would like to start building sites for NGOs -- in Portuguese, ONGs and OSCIPs -- artists and professionals, hosting them here on GitHub if possible.

I am hosting my personal wiki with [Nearly Free Speech](http://sambodianas.nfshost.com/) but to my shame cannot even afford their rock-bottom prices. I need to get back to paying translation gigs -- softrware manuals might be a good gig. I could write-translate them and also [publish them](https://readthedocs.org/).
