How do I scale and position images in Markdown? Is there some sort of 
[plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/image)?

### Dates & Data

Colin Brayton is a SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil based translator, editor and 
journalist.

Borned and raised in Lost Angles, California (1960s-198s) Colin spent 
formative periods in the San Francisco Bay Area (1984-1996) and 
Brooklyn, New York (1996-2007) as well. 
 
Colin has a Master's degree in Comparative Literature from Berkeley in 
medieval literature and also completed a ton doctoral coursework in 
Romance Philology and Arabic literature while teaching lit to freshmen.

This was before getting a life, moving to New York, and going to work as 
a journeyman [copy editor](http://www.copydesk.org/). 

Among many gigs, I -- back to the first person -- worked as copy chief of an Internet economy publication -- this was pre-9/11 -- and as managing editor and interim chief a securities industry weekly. 

Lots of fascinating stories on the early days of enterprise Linux on a massive scale. 

And so on. 

Remarkably, some of my Blogger blogs from those days are still live. 

[The Confessions of a Blind 
Tangerine](http://blindtangerine.blogspot.com.br/) (inspired by Blind 
Lemon Jefferson).

[The Red Actor](http://blindtangerine.blogspot.com.br/). 

And [The Hairy Eyeball](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hairyeyeball.net) is in The Wayback Machine, dating from May 2002. 

But I still need to find where I blogged Nine-Eleven.

Em fim: [What a long strange trip it's 
been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pafY6sZt0FE).

Colin is married to [Neuzas Paranhos](https://www.facebook.com/neuza.paranhos), a *paulistana* journalist, translator and soon to be novelist. 

### The Post-Modern Publshing Professional

Write something here about keeping up all the latest trends in 
publishing and how I have personakl experience in everything from linotype -- as a paperboy with the [South Pasadena Review](https://www.facebook.com/South-Pasadena-Review-629113357233067/) in the early 1970s -- to dedicated WordPerfect terminals and phototypesetting to making a Quark server play nice with a ColdFusion Web server and so on and so forth.

I was around when [blogs were invented and designated as such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_blogging#2001.E2.80.932004) and [Dan Bricklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin), I think it was -- father of the spreadsheet -- came out with something I think it was called HomeSite. Or was that the [Macromedia product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite)? 

But time marches on.

### Current Projects

I have just finished testing a ton of [flat-file 
CMS](http://www.flatphile.co/) solutions and a ton and a half of 
[static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) over the past few 
months.

I have a working toolset now, one that I am fairly adept at using -- 
considering I majored in poetry. 

I would really like to start building sites for NGOs -- in Portuguese, 
[ONGs](http://www.abong.org.br/links.php) and OSCIPs -- as well as 
artists and private-practice professionals, hosting them here on GitHub 
if possible.

I am hosting my personal wiki with [Nearly Free Speech](http://sambodianas.nfshost.com/) but to my shame cannot even afford their rock-bottom prices. 

I really need to get back to paying translation gigs -- software manuals 
might be a good niche. I did a little of that in my New York days, 
during which I did a little of everything 

I could write-translate docs and also [publish them](https://readthedocs.org/).   

Contact me if interested.
