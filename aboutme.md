How do I scale and position images in Markdown? <!--more-->

Is there some sort of [plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/image)?

### Dates & Data
Colin Brayton is a São Paulo, Brazil-based translator, editor and journalist.

Borned and raised in Lost Angles, California (1960s-198s), Colin spent formative periods in the San Francisco Bay Area (1984-1996) and Brooklyn, New York (1996-2007) as well. 
 
Colin has a Master's degree in Comparative Literature from Berserkeley in medieval literature and also completed a ton of doctoral coursework in Romance philology and Arabic literature while teaching lit and comp to freshmen.

This was before Colin got a life, moving to New York City and going to work as a journeyman [copy editor](http://www.copydesk.org/). 

Among many gigs, I -- the third person is pretentious -- worked as copy chief of an Internet economy publication -- this was pre-9/11 -- and as managing editor and interim chief at a securities industry trade weekly. 

Lots of fascinating stories on the early days of enterprise Linux on a massive scale. 

And so on. 

Remarkably, some of my Blogger blogs from those days are still live. 

[The Confessions of a Blind Tangerine](http://blindtangerine.blogspot.com.br/) (inspired by Blind Lemon Jefferson).

[The Red Actor](http://blindtangerine.blogspot.com.br/). 

And [The Hairy Eyeball](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hairyeyeball.net) is to be found on The Wayback Machine, dating from May 2002. 

I would still like to find where I blogged Nine-Eleven, if I was not too shell-shocked to record my reaction. 

And then there is a YouTube channel somewhere with exercises in subtitling and living out that Talking Heads song: 

«They might be better off I think / The way it seems to me / Making up their own shows / Which might be better than TV ...»

Em fim: [What a long strange trip it's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pafY6sZt0FE).

### Missus Me

Colin is married to [Neuzas Paranhos](https://www.facebook.com/neuza.paranhos), a *paulistana* journalist, translator, writer and novelist. 

Watch [this space](https://neuza-paranhos.github.io/): I intend to build The News something nice in Hugo or Pelican.

### The Post-Modern Publshing Professional

Write something here about keeping up all the latest trends in 
publishing and how I have personal experience in everything from linotype -- as a paperboy with the [South Pasadena Review](https://www.facebook.com/South-Pasadena-Review-629113357233067/) in the early 1970s -- to dedicated WordPerfect terminals and phototypesetting with hot-wax layout to making a Quark server play nice with a ColdFusion Web server and so on and so forth.

I like to boast I was around when [blogs were invented and designated as such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_blogging#2001.E2.80.932004) and [Dan Bricklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin), I think it was -- father of the spreadsheet -- came out with something I think it was called HomeSite. Or was that the [Macromedia product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite)? 

But time marches on.

### Current Projects

I have just finished testing a ton of [flat-file CMS](http://www.flatphile.co/) solutions and a ton and a half of [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) over the past few months.

I have a working tool set now, one that I am fairly adept at using --  considering I majored in poetry. 

I would really like to start building sites for NGOs -- in Portuguese, [ONGs](http://www.abong.org.br/links.php) and OSCIPs -- as well as artists and academics and private-practice professionals, hosting them here on GitHub if possible.

###Poverty Sucks

I am hosting my personal wiki with [Nearly Free Speech](http://sambodianas.nfshost.com/) but to my shame cannot even afford their rock-bottom prices. 

I really need to get back to paying translation gigs -- software manuals might be a good niche. I did a little of that in my New York days, during which I did a little of everything 

I could write-translate docs and also [publish them](https://readthedocs.org/).   
Contact me if interested.
